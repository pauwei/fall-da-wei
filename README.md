TEAM: Da Wei
THEME: API Hate

---

## Introduction

#### Project Description

#### Built With
We used React Native with Expo to create our Project.

#### Challenge
What can we do with AI/ML to detect, stop, and mitigate API hate?


## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
* Install Node
* Install Expo-Cli via npm
```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```

#### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pauwei/fall-da-wei.git
```
2. Go into project and install npm libraries
```sh
cd fall-da-wei
npm i
```
3. Run the project using the following command:
```sh
expo start
```


## Scripts

`npm start` or `expo start`

Runs the client app in development mode. Expo will automatically open a localhost for you to test using a real or virtual device

## Config
Currently has no specific configurations. May change in the future for containing keys for AI/ML API keys
